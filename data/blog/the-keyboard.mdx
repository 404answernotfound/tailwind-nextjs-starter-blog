export const KeyboardButton = ({ letter }) => {
  return <button className="kbc-button">{letter}</button>
}

## Introduction

All you need to do is add the keyboard key in the frontmatter and set its value to true, just like this blogpost.

After that, you will need to create a new Keyboard Button component, that means that your blogpost will need to be an MDX file.

```javascript
export const KeyboardButton = ({ letter }) => {
  return <button className="kbc-button">{letter}</button>
}
```

And this is how to use it in a Stackoverflow fashion:

<KeyboardButton letter="CMD"></KeyboardButton> + <KeyboardButton letter="C"></KeyboardButton>

<KeyboardButton letter="CMD"></KeyboardButton> + <KeyboardButton letter="V"></KeyboardButton>

## Important notice

This feature requires this configuration in your next.config.js file

```javascript
const ContentSecurityPolicy = `
  default-src 'self';
  script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline' giscus.app;
  style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' unpkg.com;
  img-src * blob: data:;
  media-src 'none';
  connect-src *;
  font-src 'self';
  frame-src giscus.app
`
```

unpkg.com was added to use the CDN library for the buttons to work. If you don't want to add that you should save the library locally.
